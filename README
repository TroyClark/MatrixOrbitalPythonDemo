This Python language demo was written specifically for an LK204-7T-1U, but will function for any Matrix Orbital display.

Currently, it contains functions to write data, send commands, and read a single byte from the display.

Please visit matrixorbital.ca for more information including manuals for all Matrix Orbital displays.

I am a part of the design and support teams at Matrix Orbital, but this is a project undertaken in my own time in an effort to learn Python, git, and ultimately experience what our customers do to provide better products and support in the future.

Thanks,
Troy
